# 🧩 SHG CREDIT HEALTH & LOAN READINESS SYSTEM

**(FinTech – Build2Break Ready Architecture)**

---

## 🔹 MODULE 1: SHG Profile & Data Ingestion

### What it does

Collects and standardizes all SHG-level data.

### Inputs

* SHG ID
* Group size
* Formation date
* Member turnover
* Bank linkage status
* Village / region (non-PII)

### Data Sources

* NRLM SHG datasets
* NABARD SHG-Bank linkage reports
* Synthetic SHG metadata (for missing fields)

### Output

* Clean SHG profile (JSON)

### Break Phase Risks

* Missing fields
* Inconsistent group size
* Time gaps

---

## 🔹 MODULE 2: Financial Discipline Scoring (ML)

### What it does

Measures how consistently the group handles money.

### Inputs

* Monthly savings amount
* Savings regularity
* Loan repayment history
* Missed installments
* Repayment variance

### Model

* Random Forest / XGBoost

### Output

* Financial Discipline Score (0–100)

### Why it matters

Strongest predictor of repayment behavior.

### Break Risks

* Zero savings months
* Artificial inflation
* Outlier dominance

---

## 🔹 MODULE 3: Group Stability & Continuity Scoring (ML + Rules)

### What it does

Evaluates whether the group is **stable enough** for credit.

### Inputs

* Attendance %
* Member dropout rate
* Meeting regularity
* Leadership changes
* Dominant member concentration

### Approach

* Hybrid ML + rule-based penalties

### Output

* Stability Score (0–100)

### Break Risks

* Proxy attendance
* Short-term consistency masking long-term instability

---

## 🔹 MODULE 4: Growth Readiness Scoring (ML)

### What it does

Estimates whether the SHG is ready to **handle larger credit**.

### Inputs

* Savings growth trend
* Past loan utilization efficiency
* Enterprise activity indicators
* Income stability proxies

### Model

* Gradient Boosted Trees

### Output

* Growth Readiness Score (0–100)

### Break Risks

* Sudden growth spikes
* Seasonality manipulation

---

## 🔹 MODULE 5: Behavioral Safety & Anomaly Detection (AI + ML)

### What it does

Flags unusual or risky patterns.

### Inputs

* Transaction sequences
* Savings jumps
* Attendance anomalies
* Repayment timing shifts

### Model

* Isolation Forest / LOF

### Output

* Behavioral Risk Score
* Anomaly Flags

### AI Layer

* Narrates **why** something is suspicious

### Break Risks

* Synthetic noise
* Edge-case patterns

---

## 🔹 MODULE 6: Peer Comparison Engine (Statistical + AI)

### What it does

Compares SHG performance against **similar SHGs**.

### Inputs

* Region
* Group age
* Group size
* Savings level

### Output

* Percentile Rank
* Peer-adjusted score

### AI Role

Explains relative performance:

> “Top 30% in savings but bottom 20% in attendance consistency.”

### Break Risks

* Skewed peer groups
* Sparse data

---

## 🔹 MODULE 7: Composite Credit Health Scoring Engine

### What it does

Combines all module outputs into **one interpretable score**.

### Formula (current)

```
Final Score =
0.30 * Financial Discipline
+ 0.25 * Stability
+ 0.20 * Growth Readiness
+ 0.15 * Behavioral Safety
+ 0.10 * Peer Comparison
```

### Output

* Credit Health Score (0–100)
* Loan Readiness Status

### Break Risks

* Weight gaming
* Single-module dominance

---

## 🔹 MODULE 8: Explainability Engine (SHAP + AI)

### What it does

Explains:

* Why the score is high/low
* What helped / hurt
* What to improve

### Outputs

* Feature importance
* Plain-language explanation

### Example

> “Low attendance consistency reduced the score by 12 points.”

### Break Risks

* Explanation mismatch
* Feature leakage

---

## 🔹 MODULE 9: AI Credit Analyst (Reasoning Layer)

### What it does

Acts like a **virtual loan officer**.

### Inputs

* All module scores
* Flags
* Trends

### Outputs

* Credit summary
* Risk narrative
* Recommendation

### Example

> “Moderate readiness. Improve attendance stability before loan sanction.”

### Break Risks

* Prompt injection
* Hallucination → defended via templates

---

## 🔹 MODULE 10: What-If & Intervention Advisor (AI)

### What it does

Answers:

> “What should this SHG improve?”

### Outputs

* Top 3 improvement actions
* Estimated score uplift

### Break Risks

* Unrealistic suggestions
* Overfitting advice

---

## 🔹 MODULE 11: Dashboard & Visualization (Frontend)

### What it does

Shows everything clearly.

### Views

* SHG overview
* Module-wise scores
* Trend graphs
* Risk alerts
* AI explanations

### Tech

* Streamlit / React

### Break Risks

* Broken flows
* Data mismatch

---

## 🔹 MODULE 12: System Guardrails & Ethics Layer

### What it does

Ensures **legal + ethical safety**.

### Features

* Advisory-only disclaimer
* No automated approval
* No PII storage
* Transparent assumptions

### Break Risks

* Missing disclaimers
* Overclaiming authority
